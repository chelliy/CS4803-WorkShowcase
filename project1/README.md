This project create a synthetic terrain that includes random height variations. In particular,it used Perlin noise to create terrain that has both large and small height variations. Also it added color to your terrain using a texture map. It will also create new terrain on demand, when the camera moves too far.  Finally, it have some very simple plants on the terrain.
